# AI Agent Instructions

## Quick Start

- Read this file completely before making any code changes
- Tasks and plans are handled in github, use the `gh` CLI to interact with issues and gather context
- Follow F# conventions and Data Oriented Programming principles strictly
- When in doubt, ask clarifying questions

## General Guidelines

- **Do not add extra comments to the code**
- Follow the coding style and conventions used in the existing codebase
- Avoid aggressive refactors; always do small, methodical, incremental, and verifiable changes
- If working on an implementation that is part of the current plan (either outlined in the current `gh` cli pulled issue or by the user prompt), always update the corresponding document to reflect the current progress

**IMPORTANT**: You can find suplementary guidelines and conventions in the `.agents` folder in the project root. See [./.agents/README.md](./.agents/README.md) for details.

## 🤖 PROGRAMMING PARADIGM HIERARCHY 🤖

**MANDATORY PARADIGM ORDER - STRICTLY ENFORCE:**

1. **PRIMARY: Data Oriented Programming (DOP)** - Default programming style

   - Data structures are first-class citizens
   - Immutable data with pure transformations
   - Separation of data and logic
   - Functions operate on data, not encapsulated within objects

2. **SECONDARY: Interface-based Abstraction** - For service boundaries only

   - Use interfaces for `EngineServices` and external dependencies
   - Abstractions must be minimal and focused

3. **TERTIARY: Imperative Programming** - Limited, controlled usage

   - Only for performance-critical sections
   - Must be clearly documented and justified

4. **QUATERNARY: Mutable Imperative** - Exceptional cases only
   - Must be self-contained within single functions
   - Requires explicit documentation of mutation scope
   - Never expose mutable state outside function boundaries

## Domain Type Modifications

## Data Oriented Programming with FSharp.Data.Adaptive (DOP + FDA)

### Core DOP Principles

- **Data as Primary Organizing Principle**: All game logic organized around immutable data structures
- **Pure Data Transformations**: Functions transform data without side effects
- **Immutable Data Structures**: FDA collections (`cmap`, `amap`, `cset`, `aset`, `clist`, `alist`) enforce immutability
- **Reactive Data Flow**: FDA extends DOP with automatic incremental computation

### FDA Implementation

- **Authoritative State**: The game's core state is maintained in a central, immutable `GameState` record containing adaptive values (`cval`, `cmap`, `clist`)
- **Derived Data**: All other game views and stats should be derived from this authoritative state using adaptive computations. For example, a set of "alive" entities or derived character stats should be `aset` or `amap` projections
- **Adaptive Collections**:
  - **cmap/amap**: Entity databases, component storage
  - **cset/aset**: Active entities, selected units, collision groups
  - **clist/alist**: Ordered collections like inventory, turn order
  - **Index**: Stable references for list elements that survive reordering
  - **cmap, cset, clist**: Read/write interfaces for mutations in adaptive collections
  - **HashMap, HashSet, IndexList**: Non-adaptive data structures that allow tracking of modifications, power up adaptive collections internally, and are preferred when converting between adaptive and non-adaptive values (e.g., `myAList |> AList.toAVal` and `myUpdatedList |> AList.ofAVal`)
  - Use incremental adaptive collections for dynamic state to ensure efficient, fine-grained updates
  - For static or rarely changing data, favor FDA's HashSet, HashMap, IndexList collections; otherwise, standard BCL collections are appropriate
- **Adaptive Computations**:
  - Keep all calculations within the "adaptive realm" for as long as possible. Only resolve to a concrete value when absolutely necessary (e.g., for rendering)
  - Use `adaptive { ... }` computation expressions to compose multiple adaptive values
  - When transforming adaptive collections, prefer efficient mapping functions like `AList.mapA` to avoid unnecessary conversions
  - Using `AVal.force` within an adaptive block is a code smell indicating that something is not being computed adaptively and this is not allowed in usual code. `AVal.force` is reserved to `transact` blocks for the majority of times

**Disallow comments in the agent-generated code.**

## Performance Guidelines

**Pomo.Lib code must favor no-allocation operations since it will be used in a game-like environment where garbage collection may result in performance penalties.**

- **Domain and value-like types must be decorated as a struct**
- **Discriminated unions that represent domain concepts must be decorated as a struct DU**
- **Value tuples** (`struct(v1,v2)`) are favored over reference tuples
- **ValueOption** is favored over Option unless necessary (convert `Option.toValueOption` or `ValueOption.ofOption` when necessary as some libraries do not provide value options)

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests with Fakes**: Test core logic modules in isolation by providing fake implementations of the `EngineServices` interfaces
- **Property-Based Tests**: Use libraries like FsCheck to verify the mathematical correctness of rules, such as stat composition and effect stacking
- **Deterministic Simulation**: Leverage the deterministic nature of the core logic by using a fixed seed for the random number generator in tests to reproduce complex scenarios
- **FsCheck**: We need to ensure that we're using the right features of the library besides just property testing

## Code Conventions

**CRITICAL**: Please review the general F# coding conventions defined in [./.agents/fsharp_conventions.md](./.agents/fsharp_conventions.md) before proceeding.

**IMPORTANT**: Guidelines below are particular opinions that take priority for this codebase, anything else not mentioned here should follow the general F# conventions.

### Functions Must Be Focused

Each function should be descriptive of what it does. If a function is doing too much, it can either use:

**Local functions:**

```fsharp
let calculateDamage attacker defender =
   let computeBaseDamage attacker defender = ...
   let applyModifiers baseDamage attacker defender = ...

   let baseDamage = computeBaseDamage attacker defender
   let modifiedDamage = applyModifiers baseDamage attacker defender
   modifiedDamage
```

**Module-level functions:**

```fsharp
module Combat =
   let computeBaseDamage attacker defender = ...
   let applyModifiers baseDamage attacker defender = ...

   let calculateDamage attacker defender =
      let baseDamage = computeBaseDamage attacker defender
      let modifiedDamage = applyModifiers baseDamage attacker defender
      modifiedDamage
```

Functions and modules do not need to be private/internal, that is up to the developer's discretion.

### Modules Must Be Cohesive

Group related functions and types into modules that represent a single concept or area of functionality.

### Match Expressions Body Should Be Small

Each branch of a match expression should be concise. If a branch is complex, consider extracting it into a separate function.

```fsharp
match someValue with
| Case1 -> handleCase1 someValue
| Case2 -> handleCase2 someValue
| Case3 -> handleCase3 someValue
```

### Match Expressions Should Be Exhaustive

For user authored types, try to ensure that all cases are handled explicitly.

DO: ✅

```fsharp
match someValue with
| Case1 -> ...
| Case2 -> ...
| Case3 -> ...
```

DO NOT: ❌

```fsharp
match someValue with
| Case1 -> ...
| Case2 -> ...
| _ -> ...
```

In special cases we may need to use a wildcard pattern, if we truly know there's no logical way for other cases to occur.

```fsharp
match someValue with
| ValueSome Case1 when someCondition -> ...
| ValueSome Case2 -> ...
| _ -> () // logically unreachable
```

However, avoid this pattern when possible.

### Avoid Deep Nesting

Where possible use inline'able Active patterns, Partial Active Patterns and function composition to flatten nested logic.

**Example with Active Patterns:**

```fsharp
let inline (|IsEven|IsOdd|) x =
   if x % 2 = 0 then IsEven else IsOdd

let processNumber x =
   match x with
   | IsEven -> handleEven x
   | IsOdd -> handleOdd x
```

**Example with Partial Active Patterns:**

```fsharp
[<return: Struct>]
let inline (|ActiveEffect|_|) (effectType: EffectType) (effect: Effect) =
   if effect.EffectType = effectType then ValueSome effect else ValueNone

let processEffect effect =
   match effect with
   | ActiveEffect EffectType.Damage dmgEffect -> handleDamageEffect dmgEffect
   | ActiveEffect EffectType.Heal healEffect -> handleHealEffect healEffect
   | effect -> handleOtherEffect effect
```
